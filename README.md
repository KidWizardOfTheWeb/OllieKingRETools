# OllieKingRETools - By Kid Chameleon (KC)
Tools for extraction of models, textures, animations, and more from Ollie King.
Extraction scripts currently include:
> Character models.
> 
> Animations.
> 
> Textures.
> 
> Stages (WIP).
> 
> Audience characters & animations (WIP).

### General info
The tools you will find in this repository will include scripts designed for use with programs such as Noesis and blender. However, I do not provide any assets from the game in this repository, as this repository is only for scripting designed to parse and extract said assets. It is also not legal to host assets I don't own (for those who wonder why that is a stipulation at all).

### File information and layout
Each file is listed in the proper folder named for each application they're used in. The python file name should be enough to explain what type of asset they're for, but if not, it is described in a text file or in the comments of the code at the top.
Side note: any modifications to this script that you do on your own is at your own risk. The code here is enough to extract most assets, but if there are changes you think should be in here or any upgrades or fixes to existing scripts you've created, don't be afraid to submit a PR (very appreciated for a game like this btw, not many people work on it).

### Final Notes
Please do not repost scripts without credit to those who put time into them, or better yet, link the repo. That is also chill.
I may not have a license here but be a good human being about this stuff.

### Credits and major shoutouts to:
> Texture script: Original script by DKDave (Xentax), 2021. I added more cases and support later on for other textures.
> 
> Model and animation script: Original script by DKDave (Xentax), Joschka (Xentax). They helped me understand how to get started with extraction and it allowed me to expand on what they had to involve more in the script.
> 
> EgregiousGuy (NaomiMod community) for inspiration and support, as well as helping me figure out parts of the model formats for characters and stages.
> 
> The rest of the NaomiMod community and the Xentax community for helping me get started on this project and learning more about how to RE games.
> 
> Rich Whitehouse for creating Noesis (simply the best model viewer to ever do it).
> 
> The JSR/JSRF communities for being interested in such a project like this.
> 
> Anyone who cares about this game like I do.
