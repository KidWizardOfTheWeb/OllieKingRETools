# OllieKingRETools
Tools for extraction of models, textures, animations, and more from Ollie King 

-General info-
The tools you will find in this repository will include scripts designed for use with numerous programs such as noesis and blender. However, I do not provide any assets from the game in this repository, as this repository is only for scripting designed to parse and extract said assets.

-File information and layout-
Each file is listed in the proper folder named for each application they're used in. The file name should be enough to explain what asset they're for, but if not then it should be described in a text file or in the comments of the code at the top.
Side note: any modifications to this script that you do on your own is at your own risk. The commits and PRs accepted here should be all you need, but if there are changes you think should be in here, don't be afraid to submit a PR. 

-Final Notes-
Please do not repost scripts without credit, or better yet, link the repository. Much easier if there was a recent change that way.
